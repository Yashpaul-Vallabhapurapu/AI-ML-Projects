Hi Friends, this is a classic project for overall idea of Data Science(Sales Prediction with Deep Learning) . This project has all the spices right from data cleaning, Model Predictions comparing with baseline models and drwaing insights from all the data visualization reports useful for furthur implementations of models. Last but not least I have given some conclusions for the sales data on how sales can be improved in next years. The prominent algorithm i have used is LSTM for time series data prediction. As a desert to the meal i have made explainer dashboards in-oder to visualize the performance of Models.


The Seggregation of project has been given below:

Section 1: Data Visualization

Analyzed the data of individual stores and draw insights based on the following:

  1.	Provided the box plots and statistics of 27 products, inventory patterns, stock out patterns and missed sales.
  2.	Shown graphs of best seller and worst seller products of top 25% and bottom 25% and provide your insight into data. (The average selling price of a product is 3$). Go beyond graphs and just analyzing data.
  3.	Shown graphs of best and worst products based on their inventory management - Top 25% and bottom 25% and provide your insight into data (the average cost of a product is 0.5$) Identify where/when the store gets rid of the unpurchased products.
  4.	Identified stock outs and estimate the loss of sales per year per product. Assume when we are out of stock, we conservatively lose 75% of the average of sales in the previous 4 weeks on the same weekday.
      a.	Impact of day of the week on sales and stocks (7 days)
      b.	Monthly changes and patterns (for the duration of the data)
      c.	Impact of weather condition
  6.	Investigated whether drive thru feature causes certain products to sell better or worse.
  7.	Investigated the impact of weekday/weekends and National Holidays by adding extra features.
  8.	Based on the store data, identified the stocking patterns across multiple stores. Are they provided with new products every day or restocking happens less frequently based on your insights? 
  
  
  
Section 2:  Prediction

The purpose of this section is to come up with a predictor for sales of each product based on which we can optimize the restocking and inventory management of stores

Section 3:  Inventory optimization

Based on the sales predictions model from the previous sections, provided three inventory optimization initiatives and examined them on my data.
